# heroku-demo

heroku-demo is a personal repository to learn and demonstrate Heroku + Django.

The Heroku app can be found [here](https://calm-escarpment-45678.herokuapp.com/).

The goals of the repository are to create a website with:

  - a static page
  - a dynamic component
  - some periodic task
  - a Google map with marked locations

Additional tools I will be looking at:

 - jquery
 - bootstrap
 - less
 - gulp
 - node
 - grunt
 - bower
 - uglify
 
*__Note:__ This list may be frequently updated*
  
A detailed progress log is located in the repository wiki.
